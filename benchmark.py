eval_intergrals.py

This script evaluates whether an LLM-generated solution for an integral is correct.
It:
  1. Prompts the LLM to solve an integral (provided as text) and return the solution 
     wrapped in <answer> ... </answer> tags as a valid Python sympy expression.
     For definite integrals (with bounds specified as "from x=... to x=..."), the answer should be the numerical value.
     For indefinite integrals, the answer should be an antiderivative.
  2. Extracts the candidate solution from within the <answer> tags while retaining the full raw LLM response.
  3. Verifies the candidate solution using numerical methods:
       - For definite integrals, it compares the candidate value with a numerical quadrature result.
       - For indefinite integrals, it evaluates F(b)-F(a) on random intervals and compares with numerical integration.
  4. Returns the candidate solution, the computed solution (or numerical result), the full raw LLM response, and a correctness flag.
  
Additionally, this script loads a list of integrals from a questions file, benchmarks the model's performance
across many integrals, prints progress and an overall accuracy summary, and optionally saves a new Python file
with only the integrals that were answered incorrectly.

Usage example:
    python eval_intergrals.py
