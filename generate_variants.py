"""
self_improve.py

An experimental pipeline that:
- Accepts an integral (or uses a preset one) and a set of difficulty targets.
- For each requested difficulty (e.g., easier, equivalent, or harder) it generates several variants.
- Each LLM prompt now generates up to 10 variants at once. If the user requests more than 10 variants,
  the work is split into multiple concurrent calls.
- Each variantâ€™s antiderivative is attempted symbolically via Sympy.
- A second LLM prompt asks for a difficulty evaluation (easier/harder/equivalent) as a double-check.
- The antiderivative solution (i.e. the integration result) is computed, and it is evaluated at three random points.
- Points that produce complex values are skipped.
- Variants judged as "harder" are filtered out when not desired.
- All results are saved to "variants.json".

If the integration (antiderivative computation) takes more than 5 seconds, it is skipped and the variant is
returned with a solution of None (and an empty evaluation dictionary), rather than being thrown out.
